## What's in the repo?

This is an [Nx Standalone Workspace](https://nx.dev/concepts/integrated-vs-package-based) containing an Angular application as well as a custom Nx plugin in the folder `workspace-extensions`.

The plugin contains

- a generator that runs the Nx Angular library generator and then overwrites/customizes the README as an example how you can customize the generators to your needs. You can run the generator with `npx nx g @ngconf23/workspace-extensions:customlib somename`
- an executor that takes the README.md and compiles it to HTML as an example of how you can wrap a process into an Nx executor. The executor is registered on the `modules/nglib` project as a `compilemd` target. Open the `project.json` to see how it is done. To run it, just run `npx nx compilemd nglib`.
